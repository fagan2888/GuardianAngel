 Guardian Angel
 --------------
 Crash detection and lean-angle measurement for motorcycles.

 Crash detection
 ---------------
 If the angle is greater than a limit (say 60 degrees) for more than a
 set period of time (say 5 seconds), we take this to mean that the bike
 has fallen over or crashed.

 In this case we send a text to specified numbers saying that the bike has
 crashed and giving a link to Google maps pointing to the location.

 Lean angle measurement
 ----------------------
 For each trip we record the maximum and minimum lean angle. At the end of the
 trip you can see this, along with where they occurred.
